                        <p>To cap off my time at A&M, I spent 6 months with the College of Nursing creating a website to connect 
                            rural folks with healthcare and community resources. I pulled double duty as both developer and project manager,
                             eventually earning the College a sizable continuing research grant. </p>

                        <p>After serving, delivering pizzas, and working at an escape room, I was <em>ecstatic</em> to land 
                            an internship at Ethos Group. Here I learned about creating clean and maintanable code while developing 
                            financial tools for the auto industry. I liked it so much that I stuck around for another internship and 
                            some part time work during the school year. Also, I adopted my dog Ronan from Aggieland Humane Society!</p>

                        <p>I rolled up to A&M with zero clue what I wanted to do in life. Then I started writing some basic programming 
                            Python projects in Engineering 102 and it was love at first sight. I also became heavily invested in ASSIST, 
                            a service org where I coordinated 60 volunteers and planned an entire <em>carnival</em> for Hope For Three, 
                            a non-profit from my homeotown that supports families who have children with autism.</p>
